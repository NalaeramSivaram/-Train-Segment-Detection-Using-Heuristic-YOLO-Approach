# ðŸš‚ Train-Segment-Detection-Using-Heuristic-YOLO-Approach
This repository contains a Python-based project that detects and counts train segmentsâ€”Engines, Wagons, and Brakevansâ€”from side-view train videos using a heuristic approach with YOLO. The solution works without requiring custom training.

## Project Overview ##
The goal of this project is to automatically analyze train videos and estimate the **number of engines, wagons, and brakevans.**
Since no labeled dataset was available for train components, a **heuristic method** was developed using the **pretrained YOLOv8 model** (trained on COCO) to detect general train objects and estimate the train composition.

### How It Works ###
**Step 1: Frame Extraction**

  *  The input train video is split into individual frames.
  *  Frames are extracted at a regular interval (e.g., every 30 frames) to reduce computation.
  *  Extracted frames are saved for processing and optional annotation.

**Step 2: YOLO Detection**

  *  A pretrained YOLOv8 model (yolov8n.pt) is used to detect objects in each frame.
  *  Since YOLO does not know about "engine" or "brakevan" by default, the model detects train objects.

**Step 3: Heuristic Counting**

  *  A  The detected train bounding boxes are sorted left-to-right in each frame.
  *  Counting rules:
        Engine â†’ first bounding box in the frame (front of the train).
        Brakevan â†’ last bounding box in the frame (end of the train).
        Wagons â†’ all intermediate bounding boxes.
This allows approximate counting of train components without requiring labeled data or custom YOLO training.

**Step 4: Annotated Frames**

  *  Each detected train segment is optionally annotated with bounding boxes.
  *  Annotated frames can be saved for visualization or further analysis.

**Step 5: Report Generation**
     
    A PDF report summarizes:
  *  Count of engines, wagons, and brakevans
  *  Total segments detected
  *  Visual bar chart of distribution
    A performance summary text file is also generated.
